With SchoolTime, it is easy to see the time left in each period during the school day.

To modify SchoolTime to work with your school, simply import SchoolTime into cloudpebble and change struct periodInfo found in schedules.h to work with your school's bell schedule. 

Your version of SchoolTime can be shared privately across pebble owners who follow your school time, but can not be published publicly on the pebble app store or any other public site. 

Modified versions of the settings page are only able to be used for personal use. 
The settings page for each watch can be found here http://ben624.com/SchoolTime/SDK3/
This settings page requires a .js and .css to function correctly. 
You settings page MAY NOT use the .js and .css hosted on Ben624.com. You must host the files on your site. 

If the build fails inside of cloudpebble, try re-importing the resources by downloading the SchoolTime ZIP and saving the resources back into cloudpebble manually.

If you have any additional issues, please feel free to open an issue of github, click on message developer from the pebble app, or send me an e-mail (ben@ben624.com)
